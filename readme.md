[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hook and Python code formatter for iPython cell delimiters (`# %%`). Ensures

- cells are preceded by two empty lines:

    ```py
    # %%
    foo='bar'
    # %%
    ```

    ```py
    # %%
    foo='bar'


    # %%
    ```

- empty cells are removed:

    ```py
    # %%

    # %%
    ```

    ```py
    # %%
    ```

- same-line comments are separated by a single space:

    ```py
    # %%some comment
    foo = 'bar'
    # %%    another comment
    ```

    ```py
    # %% some comment
    foo = 'bar'
    # %% another comment
    ```

## Usage as CLI

```sh
format-ipy-cells path/to/one-or-more/files
```

## Install as `pre-commit` hook
